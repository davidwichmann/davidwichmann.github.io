## Education

### PhD in Physical Oceanography, Utrecht University (2017-2021)
In my PhD at Utrecht University, I worked on the numerical modelling of transport processes in the ocean. A main focus in my PhD was the use of unsupervised learning techniques as well as network theory to extract structure from simulated and measured ocean trajectory data.
